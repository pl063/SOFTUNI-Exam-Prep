# SOFTUNI-Exam-Prep
Uploading solutions to exam preparations from SOFTUNI. 
	Current module: JS Advanced. 
	I'm not going to upload any of the tasks' conditions since I'm not sure if I have the right to publish them without permission. 
	Some of the commented code is old version of the current. 
	I'll appreciate any feedback and constructive criticism :)
